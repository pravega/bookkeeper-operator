# Bookkeeper Operator Helm Chart

Installs [Bookkeeper Operator](https://github.com/pravega/bookkeeper-operator) to create/configure/manage Bookkeeper clusters atop Kubernetes.

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Bookkeeper Operator](https://github.com/pravega/bookkeeper-operator) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager. The chart can be installed multiple times to create Bookkeeper Operator on multiple namespaces.

## Prerequisites
  - Kubernetes 1.15+ with Beta APIs
  - Helm 3.2.1+
  - An existing Apache Zookeeper 3.6.1 cluster. This can be easily deployed using our [Zookeeper Operator](https://github.com/pravega/zookeeper-operator)
  - Cert-Manager v0.15.0+ or some other certificate management solution in order to manage the webhook service certificates. This can be easily deployed by referring to [this](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/)
  - An Issuer and a Certificate (either self-signed or CA signed) in the same namespace that the Bookkeeper Operator will be installed (refer to [this](https://github.com/pravega/bookkeeper-operator/blob/master/deploy/certificate.yaml) manifest to create a self-signed certificate in the default namespace)

## Installing the Chart

To install the bookkeeper-operator chart, use the following commands:

```
$ helm repo add pravega https://charts.pravega.io
$ helm repo update
$ helm install [RELEASE_NAME] pravega/bookkeeper-operator --version=[VERSION] --set webhookCert.certName=[CERT_NAME] --set webhookCert.secretName=[SECRET_NAME]
```
where:
- **[RELEASE_NAME]** is the release name for the bookkeeper-operator chart
- **[DEPLOYMENT_NAME]** is the name of the bookkeeper-operator deployment so created. (If [RELEASE_NAME] contains the string `bookkeeper-operator`, `[DEPLOYMENT_NAME] = [RELEASE_NAME]`, else `[DEPLOYMENT_NAME] = [RELEASE_NAME]-bookkeeper-operator`. The [DEPLOYMENT_NAME] can however be overridden by providing `--set fullnameOverride=[DEPLOYMENT_NAME]` along with the helm install command)
- **[VERSION]** can be any stable release version for bookkeeper-operator from 0.1.3 onwards
- **[CERT_NAME]** is the name of the certificate created as a prerequisite
- **[SECRET_NAME]** is the name of the secret created by the above certificate

This command deploys a bookkeeper-operator on the Kubernetes cluster in its default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

>Note: If the bookkeeper-operator version is 0.1.2+, webhookCert.certName and webhookCert.secretName should not be set. Also in this case, cert-manager and the certificate/issuer do not need to be deployed as prerequisites.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the bookkeeper-operator chart, use the following command:

```
$ helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME]
```

This command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
