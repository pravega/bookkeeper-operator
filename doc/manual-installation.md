### Install the Operator manually

> Note: If you are running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), please [check this first](#installation-on-google-kubernetes-engine).

Register the Bookkeeper cluster custom resource definition (CRD).

```
$ kubectl create -f deploy/crds/crd.yaml
```

Create the operator role, role binding and service account.

```
$ kubectl create -f deploy/role.yaml
$ kubectl create -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
$ kubectl create -f deploy/service_account.yaml
```

Install the operator.

```
$ kubectl create -f deploy/operator.yaml
```

Finally create a ConfigMap which contains the list of supported upgrade paths for the Bookkeeper cluster.

```
$ kubectl create -f deploy/version_map.yaml
```

#### Install the Operator in Test Mode
The operator can be deployed in `test mode` by providing the argument `-test` inside the `operator.yaml` file in the following way.

```
containers:
  - name: bookkeeper-operator
    image: pravega/bookkeeper-operator:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 60000
      name: metrics
    command:
    - bookkeeper-operator
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    args: [-test]
```
For more details check [this](../README.md#install-the-operator-in-test-mode)

### Install the Bookkeeper cluster manually

If the BookKeeper cluster is expected to work with Pravega, we need to create a ConfigMap which needs to have the following values

| KEY | VALUE |
|---|---|
| *PRAVEGA_CLUSTER_NAME* | Name of Pravega Cluster using this BookKeeper Cluster |
| *WAIT_FOR* | Zookeeper URL |

To create this ConfigMap.

```
$ kubectl create -f deploy/config_map.yaml
```

The name of this ConfigMap needs to be mentioned in the field `envVars` present in the BookKeeper Spec. For more details about this ConfigMap refer to [this](bookkeeper-options.md#bookkeeper-custom-configuration).

Once all these have been installed, you can use the following YAML template to install a small development Bookkeeper Cluster. Create a `bookkeeper.yaml` file with the following content.

```yaml
apiVersion: "bookkeeper.pravega.io/v1alpha1"
kind: "BookkeeperCluster"
metadata:
  name: "pravega-bk"
spec:
  version: 0.7.0
  zookeeperUri: [ZOOKEEPER_HOST]:2181
  envVars: bk-config-map
  replicas: 3
  image:
    repository: pravega/bookkeeper
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

where:

- `[ZOOKEEPER_HOST]` is the host or IP address of your Zookeeper deployment.

Check out other sample CR files in the [`example`](../example) directory.

Deploy the Bookkeeper cluster.

```
$ kubectl create -f bookkeeper.yaml
```

Verify that the cluster instances and its components are being created.

```
$ kubectl get bk
NAME         VERSION   DESIRED MEMBERS    READY MEMBERS      AGE
pravega-bk   0.7.0     3                  0                  25s
```

### Uninstall the Bookkeeper cluster manually

```
$ kubectl delete -f bookkeeper.yaml
```

### Uninstall the Operator manually

> Note that the Bookkeeper cluster managed by the Bookkeeper operator will NOT be deleted even if the operator is uninstalled.

To delete all clusters, delete all cluster CR objects before uninstalling the operator.

```
$ kubectl delete -f deploy
```
